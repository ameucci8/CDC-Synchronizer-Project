# Clock Domain Crossing Data Synchronize Project
Designed a fully gate-level RISC processor in SystemVerilog that increased throughput of 32 bit instructions between memory and processor. In testing, the synchronizer increased run time by 60%, from 2750ns to 1140ns.
Developed a synchronizer using asynchronous FIFO to allow for clock domain crossing between a processor and a shared memory operating at different clock frequencies, verified using ModelSim.
